## Simple Summary
A Public Autonomous Zero-Identity Standard Interface Based on ETH Address And The Management of Smart Contract.

## Abstract
This protocol allows a user to register a zero-identity and get one or more backup zero-identities by running smart contracts. The protocol defines methods to register with a zero-identity, query or replace a zero-identity. Especially this protocol allows a user to replace his/her current zero-identity with a backup zero-identity and generates one or more backup identities. This protocol is a fundamental protocol for the blockchain's decentralized autonomous ecosystems.

## Motivation
We intend to develop a zero-identity interface which can be used by smart contracts. In Ethereum any smart contract takes an Ethereum address as a user's zero-identity. Quite often a user will lose access to his/her crypto assets when his/her private key associated with his ETH address is lost or stolen, or after he/she has transferred some tokens to a malicious or buggy smart contract. We are motivated to design a mechanism to help a user minimize his/her loss when these occassions happen.
This is a fundamental protocol which an ideal public autonomous blockchain zero-identity system is based on. It is a key proposal for building blockchain decentralized autonomous ecosystems, such as decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).

## Specification


## Implementation
* **NewZidReg** To register a new zero-identity and generates a new backup zero-identity.
* **ZidReclaimed** Claims loss of an active zero-identity or change of an active zero-identity. When a user's private key is lost or compromised he/she can call this function for the claim to abolish the zero-identity associated with the lost private key and activate a backup zero-identity as his/her new zero-identity and generate a new backup zero-identity as well. This function specifies which zero-identity will be abolished, which zero-identity will be used as an active zero-identity and what new backup zero-identity generated. In addition this function can trace all addresses of all the smart contracts the abolished zero-identity has participated.   
* **getActiveZid** Queries whether or not an Ethereum address is an active zero-identity.
* **getCurrentCandidate** Queries the backup zero-identity (or zero-identities) for a zero-identity no matter whether or not this zero-identity is active or abolished. 
* **Implementation** for a user with multiple zero-identities a doubly linked list can be used to link all of them. Let the first generated zero-identity be denoted as A, its backup zero-identity be denoted as B and address(0) be denoted as nil. We doubly link A, B and nil by calling main2Candidate to do A -> B -> nil and calling candidate2Main to do B -> A -> nil. When A is abandoned, B is set as the new zero-identity and C is set as the new backup zero-identity we  will call main2Candidate to do A -> B -> C -> nil and call candidate2Main to do C -> B -> A -> nil. When D is set as the new backup zero-identity we will call main2Candidate to do A -> B -> C -> -> D -> nil and call candidate2Main to do D -> C -> B -> A -> nil. An enquery of any node in this doubly linked list returns the node's status, e.g. whether or not this node is an active zero-identity or whether or not this node is a backup zero-identity etc. By adopting this mechanism we can prevent smart contracts to tranfer tokents to an abolished zero-identity, thus minimize a user's loss.
getZidType queries a zero-identity's type
* **ZidVerifyDone** verifies a query of zero-identity is completed.
* **SmartContractExecuted** Accomplished smart contract lists.

## Rationale
<!--The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

## Backwards Compatibility
<!--All EIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The EIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. EIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.-->

## Implementation
<!--The implementations must be completed before any EIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the EIP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.-->
